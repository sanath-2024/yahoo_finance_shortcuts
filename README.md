# Yahoo Finance Shortcuts

I made a Chrome extension to help investors quickly get to the page they want on Yahoo Finance.

This is an *unofficial* extension not supported in any way by Yahoo.

## Installation Instructions

1. Download the repository as a zip.
2. Unzip the repository.
3. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in the Google Chrome browser.
4. If developer mode is not already turned on, turn it on by pressing the slider at the upper right-hand corner of the page.
5. Click the "Load unpacked" button.
6. The directory (folder) that you unzipped in step 2 should contain a single sub-directory. Load that sub-directory.
